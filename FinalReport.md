**Summary:**
Our project is a maintance ticket dashboard and reporting system. A Landlord can create an account and add apartments or houses to their dashboard.
When an apartment or house is added to the dashboard a sharable id is created. THe sharable id can be given to tenets so they can go to the website and submit a ticket that shows up
on the landlords dashboard. Both the landlord and tenet can track the status of their ticket.

**Demo:**
The photos are in the zip file.

**What did you learn:**
We learned how to make a dynamic colored front end, how to connect it to a database and make in a way that is scalable. 

**AI integration:**
We did integrate AI. We have an AI agent that automatically gives every new ticket a priority. It gives a priority, high, medium, and low. 

**AI use in the project:**
We did use AI, we used it to help build the app. Helped with syntax and how to actually code some parts of the app. 

**Why project is interesting:**
This project is interesting because it can help people submit and track maintanece requests. But also it has been a lot of fun to learn how to use new technologies. 

**Key learnings:**
1) How to connect a frontend to a back end (Supabase and Vercel)
2) How to make an application that has white labling
3) How to make a schema that is actually good and usable

**Explination:**
All of the failover strategies scaling and performances characteristics are handled by Vercel and Supabase
